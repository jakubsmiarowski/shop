## Project Overview

My objective was to create frontend of a internet shop based on React.js. Aplication consists of 4 pages: homepage, product details, contact page and cart. I received a basic layout of what the shop should look like and based on provided psd files I was able to create functional React bike shop.

## Technical details

1. ReactJS
2. React Router
3. Redux
4. Bootstrap

## Personal Growth

Despite this wasn't the first thing I coded myself, it was first time I didn't have strict guidelines to what actually needed to be in the project. I had opportunity to do some digging on my own, add stuff that weren't necessary to finish the project but were fun to explore (random bike showing up as a bike of the day). The most challenging thing I had to do was probably implementation of pagination and sorting of the bikes. I had some real trouble with it and I managed with a help of a tutorial found on internet that had good application to what I was building. Even though my shop wasn't graded the highest note, I'm still pretty proud of the 3 weeks I spent on this.
